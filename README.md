# Create your own Bubble

This is tool how to extract blocked persons on facebook.com.
If you include some json file from your friend, you can automatically block his blocked profiles.
*Happy blocking!*


Install dependencies:

`npm i`


Run bubbles:

`npm start`


Turn off your 2FA authentication. Do not forget to turn it back when you are finished with blocking! 2FA will be implemented soon.

Be sure, you have files in right order and right directory.
